## Our Content

Rackspace.com content has three primary goals:

* **Differentiate Rackspace from other industry players.** Rackspace has the broadest, most integrated product portfolio in the industry. Our content makes that market differentiation crystal clear.
* **Make it easy to buy.** We have around 10 seconds to capture a visitor’s interest.  Rackspace.com content communicates our value proposition and products with exceptional clarity, and then guides customers through the interest-to-purchase cycle.
* **Enable self-service.** Customers tell us that they often want self-service options over live interaction. (Who really wants to sit on the phone?) Our content enables customers to quickly and easily self educate.

As a keeper of Rackspace web content, keep these goals in mind when you write. If you receive a request to develop content that doesn’t align with these goals, question it!

## Our Writing

On the Rackspace.com team, we don’t just take the content that a subject matter expert sends us, fix the grammar and typos, and say we’re done.

* We probe to discover what our customers care about.
* We ask questions when concepts don’t make sense.
* We research new technologies that we’ve never encountered before.
* We turn tech specs into compelling conversations.
* We eliminate redundant content.
* We make sure every page is a complete experience.
* We don’t over- or under-estimate our readers’ technical expertise.
* We clearly explain Rackspace’s product portfolio, and show how products and services fit together.
* We help customers choose custom solutions that meet unique needs.

In other words, we’re not just editors—we’re skilled content developers who care deeply about customer experience. Internalize that approach, and remember it as you write.
