Buttons provide our site visitors with a clear visual reference from which to interact with rackspace.com. They are colorful and offer constrast to the content area on which they appear. This contrast, coupled with clear and concise verbiage, instructs the site visitor to engage with the website.

##Primary Buttons

Primary buttons represent an important action or behavior for a site vistor. When they are ready to take an action a Primary button provides an avenue to take this action.

###When to Use

Primary buttons are one of two types of call to action buttons used on Rackspace.com properties. Primary buttons are used for important actions that relate to the rest of page on which they appear. Use primary buttons to guide the site visitor to a specific action. The action this button represents will differ between pages. It will represent the action we want a site visitor to take on a given page and should be limited to one per page.

###How to use

Ensure the text declared in the primary button is explicit in informing the site visitor the action that will taken upon interacting with it. Explicit buttons utilize direct language and few words. A Primary button that read "Sign Up Now" or "Sign Up" are good examples of this language. Using plain language anchor the interactions available as a site visitor scans a page. We don't make them guess, we tell them. 

###User Story

While investigating web hosting companies Mary hears good things about Rackspace. She finds her way to rackspace.com and discovers we have the perfect cloud product to fit her use case while browsing the Cloud Servers product page. Having made the decision to purchase cloud hosting from Rackspace she clicks the "Sign Up Now" button prominently displayed on the product page to begin her journey to the Rackspace cloud.

###Design Rationale

The primary benefit of using buttons is that they stand apart from text links. Text links are usually used to move site visitors between pages or for low-priority commands. Action buttons, on the other hand, are used to bring focus to actions or commands that do something important. Primary buttons work better for high priority actions than links.

##Secondary Buttons 

The site visitor is almost ready to perform an action but they need additional information. This is a job for secondary buttons. They calmly say 'Click Me' (not literally) and we can continue our conversation else where.

###When to Use

###User Story

Site visitors come to rackspace.com to learn, while we create content to share our expertise and help them make the best decision to solve their particular problem. However individuals prefer to intake information differentely depending on their preferred learning style. Videos strongly address the visual and auditory learners. Embedding video buttons in content allows visual learners to gravitate towards it. It excites the auditory learner that there is a conversation to be had. Likewise by scaling the video content button down we don't drive away individuals whom are not of these learning types, allowing them to ignore the video button by not getting in the way.
