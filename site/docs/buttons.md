Buttons provide our customers with a clear visual reference from which to interact with rackspace.com. They are colorful and offer constrast to the content area on which they appear. This contrast, coupled with clear and concise verbiage, instructs the user to engage with the website.

##Primary Buttons

The customer is ready to peform an action but the webpage does not provide them clues on where to perform this action. This is where primary buttons come into play. They take the guess work out of the page and say 'Click Me' (not literally) to accomplish your goal.

###When to Use

Primary buttons are one of two types of call to action buttons used on Rackspace.com properties. Primary buttons are used for important actions that relate to the rest of page on which they appear. Use primary buttons to guide the customer to the primary call to action of a page. This call to action is the purpose of the page and the reason it exists on our site. Over use of primary buttons on page dull the impact they have on the customer. 

###How to use

Ensure the text declared in the primary button is explicit in informing the customer the action that will taken upon interacting with it. Explicit buttons utilize direct language and few words. Primary buttons that read "Get Started" or "Sign Up" are good examples of this language. Using plain language anchor the interactions available as a customer scans a page. We don't make them guess, we tell them. 

###User Story

She finds her way to rackspace.com and discovers we have the perfect cloud product to fit her use case while browsing the Cloud Servers product page.

##Secondary Buttons 

The customer is almost ready to perform an action but they need additional information. As hard as they try they can't find out where to go to continue the conversation. This is a job for secondary buttons. They calmly say 'Click Me' (not literally) and we can continue our conversation else where.

###When to Use

Secondary buttons are the second type of call to action buttons used on Rackspace.com properties. Secondary Buttons are used for less important actions than primary buttons. Use secondary buttons to call attention to a less important interation user on the page.

The verbiage is direct like that of a primary button but leave the customer feeling inquisitive. Secondary buttons that read "Learn more" provide an avenue for optional information, allowing them to easily decide if they need to interact with it.

###Design Rationale
 
Customers come to rackspace.com to learn, while we create content to share our expertise and help them make the best decision to solve their particular problem. However individuals prefer to intake information differentely depending on their preferred learning style. Videos strongly address the visual and auditory learners. Embedding video buttons in content allows visual learners to gravitate towards it. It excites the auditory learner that there is a conversation to be had. Likewise by scaling the video content button down we don't drive away individuals whom are not of these learning types, allowing them to ignore the video button by not getting in the way.
