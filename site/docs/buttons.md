Buttons provide our site visitors with a clear visual reference from which to interact with rackspace.com. They are colorful and offer constrast to the content area on which they appear. This contrast, coupled with clear and concise verbiage, instructs the site visitor to engage with the website.

##Primary Buttons

The primary button is used to represent an important action or command we want the site visitor to take. We can use primary buttons to help influence a site visitors behavior. They take the guess work out of the page and say 'Click Me' (not literally) to accomplish your goal.

###When to Use

Primary buttons are one of two types of call to action buttons used on Rackspace.com properties. Primary buttons are used for important actions that relate to the rest of page on which they appear. Primary buttons are the action we want the site visitor to take on the page and should be limited to a single action.

###How to use

Ensure the text declared in the primary button is explicit in informing the site visitor the action that will taken upon interacting with it. Explicit buttons utilize direct language and few words. Primary buttons that read "Sign Up Now" or "Sign Up" are good examples of this language. Using plain language anchor the interactions available as a site visitor scans a page. We don't make them guess, we tell them. 

###User Story

While investigating web hosting companies Mary hears good things about Rackspace. She finds her way to rackspace.com and discovers we have the perfect cloud product to fit her use case while browsing the Cloud Servers product page. Having made the decision to purchase cloud hosting from Rackspace she clicks the "Sign Up Now" button prominently displayed on the product page to begin her journey to the Rackspace cloud.

###Design Rationale

Primary buttons are important because they stand apart from text links. Text links are usually used to move site visitors between pages or for low-priority commands that have benign consequences. Primary buttons, on the other hand, bring focus to actions or commands that do something important. For high-priority actions (primary), buttons work better than links.

###Example

Primary Button displayed on a Cloud Product page

##Secondary Buttons

###When to Use

Secondary buttons are the second type of call to action buttons used on rackspace.com properties. They are used for actions or commands less important than high-priority actions and more important than text links.

###User Story

When she clicked the 'learn more' button on the Cloud Servers page, she was provided an indepth case study on the value Cloud Servers provided her business. This gave her the information required to make a sign-up decision.

###Design Rationale
 
Secondary buttons give a page greater interactivity allowing for additional conversations to upfold based on the interests of the reader.

site visitors come to rackspace.com to learn, while we create content to share our expertise and help them make the best decision to solve their particular problem. However individuals prefer to intake information differentely depending on their preferred learning style. Videos strongly address the visual and auditory learners. Embedding video buttons in content allows visual learners to gravitate towards it. It excites the auditory learner that there is a conversation to be had. Likewise by scaling the video content button down we don't drive away individuals whom are not of these learning types, allowing them to ignore the video button by not getting in the way.

###Example

<img style="width:760px; border: solid 1px black" src="http://e6e61b233bcecd895fdb-74f5ac90bad95964d53ac3322f7d0dec.r76.cf1.rackcdn.com/play_button.png">


##Social Media Links

A site visitor obtains engaging content through a rackspace.com web property and is motivated to share the content via social media.

###When to Use

Use when creating content appropriate for sharing on social media sites. For example on a blog post that can benefit I.T practitioners. Overuse of this pattern can detract from the content. Ensure social buttons are proportional to the layout of the page they reside.

###How to use

Implement social media buttons that use the iconographic standards for their respective social media outlet. Place the icons in a location that corresponds to the importance placed on sharing the content. Attaching social media buttons on top of or adjacent to the content implies a high importance for sharing. Placing social media buttons and the end of content impllies a low importance for the sharing activity.

###Design Rationale

Using this design pattern influences the site visitor to further engage with the Rackspace brand. When individuals share content they become promoters. Individuals seeing this shared content put additional eyes on Rackspace and can drive adoption.
