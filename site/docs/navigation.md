Mary has purchased the Cloud Servers product and is attempting to load her ecommerce solution on to her Cloud Server. She is eager to switch her site but wants to ensure that she has configured her Cloud Server in as secure a manner as possible.

##Main Footer

All site visitors require access to a specific feature or link regardless of the currently rendered page.

###When to Use

Use when you need to add uniformity to a webpage from both a layout and feature perspective. Each page on which the footer appears will act as a secondary level of navigation through which a site visitor can explore the site and access feature. If a footer is implemented upon the top level page of a web site it should appear on subsequent pages similar to the Eyebrow element.

###How to use

Include the footer at the bottom of each page created. Include relevent links to additional information or interactions from which a site viewer can benefit.

###User Story

While exploring rackspace.com Mary finds herself reading the Cloud Servers product page. She consumes the content on the page by reading and scrolling down the page to access additional content. She realizes she has reached the end of the page because she is greeted with the footer that was displayed on the home page. After reaching the end of the page she is interested in Cloud Load Balancers which was referenced in a list bullet point. The footer provides her an easy avenue to explore the Cloud Load Balancers product page without the need to scroll to the top of the product page. She selects the Cloud Load Balancers text link in the footer and continues browsing the site.

###Design Rationale

By providing easy access to a footer element you give visual consistency to a web site. This consistency is important as it helps explain to a site viewer they reached the end of a page. The footer acts as a secondary method for navigating the web site interactions.

###Example

Footer from rackspace.com

<img style="width:760px; border: solid 1px black;" src="http://e6e61b233bcecd895fdb-74f5ac90bad95964d53ac3322f7d0dec.r76.cf1.rackcdn.com/footer.png">


##Navigation drop Down

Navigation drop downs empower site viewers to view sub categories at their leisure. 

###When to Use

Use when displaying large navigation schemes that cannot be easily displayed on the screen. Use to isolate and bucket navigation into a scheme that fits the site viewers goals.

###How to use

Include the top level category as the interaction point from which to launch a drop down. When a customer hovers or clicks the interaction point, sub categories are displayed.
