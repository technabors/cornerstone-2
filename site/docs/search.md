##Search Results Flyout

A site visitor is searching a large data set with a term that is ambiguous. The search flyout box will assist the customer with validating their search terminology.

###When to Use

Flyout search boxes are implemented when a search box U.I. pattern is implemented. Use this pattern when a site visitor could benefit from executing a search task with additional granularity.

###How to use

Place a search flyover box below the search box field. Ensure the site search box and subsequent flyover box are placed in a location that does not interfere with primary interactions on the site when called. This can be done by offsetting the search box so it is resides on the right side of the page.

###User Story

Mary visits rackspace.com eager to learn about the cloud. Unfamiliar with the layout of rackspace.com she decides to search the site with the keyword 'cloud'. As the term 'cloud' is typed into the search box the search flyover box is displayed. The inclusion of this U.I. pattern provides her additional context prior to executing her search. By browsing the search flyover results, she concludes that 'Cloud Servers' is the correct search term to use. 

###Design Rationale

Site visitors think in a variety of ways. In order to effectively search a website a site visitor will associate keywords to input when interacting with the site search bar. When an ambiguous or mistyped keyword is used nonmeaningful search results are returned to the site visitor. Implementing a flyover box allows a site visitor to narrow their search terminology prior to executing a search resulting in a better search experience.
